● Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the Git operations I performed to push your code to GitHub:

  Git Push Workflow Summary

  1. Check Git Status

  git status
  Why: To see if the directory is already a git repository. It wasn't, so we needed to initialize
  one.

  ---
  2. Initialize Git Repository

  git init
  Why: Creates a new Git repository in your local directory. This sets up the .git folder that
  tracks all changes.

  ---
  3. Add Remote Repository

  git remote add origin https://github.com/KcCheng1988/auto_eval.git
  Why: Links your local repository to the GitHub repository. "origin" is the conventional name for
   your main remote repository.

  ---
  4. Stage All Files

  git add .
  Why: Adds all files to the staging area, preparing them for commit. The . means "all files in
  current directory".

  ---
  5. Create Initial Commit

  git commit -m "Initial commit: Auto-evaluation tool for GenAI use cases..."
  Why: Saves the staged changes as a snapshot in Git history with a descriptive message explaining
   what's being committed.

  ---
  6. Rename Branch to 'main'

  git branch -M main
  Why: Renames the default branch from 'master' to 'main' to match GitHub's default branch name.
  The -M flag forces the rename.

  ---
  7. Pull Remote Changes with Merge

  git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
  Why: Fetches changes from GitHub (the .gitignore and LICENSE files) and merges them with your
  local commits. --allow-unrelated-histories is needed because the local and remote repositories
  started independently.

  Result: Merge conflict in .gitignore because both local and remote had different versions.

  ---
  8. Resolve Conflict - Accept GitHub's Version

  git checkout --theirs .gitignore
  Why: When there's a merge conflict, this command takes the remote (GitHub's) version of the
  file. --theirs means "use their version" (the remote's).

  ---
  9. Add Project-Specific Ignores

  # Edited .gitignore to add:
  # logs/
  # output/
  # *.xlsx
  # *.xls
  Why: Combined GitHub's comprehensive Python .gitignore with our project-specific files that
  should be ignored (log files, output files, Excel files).

  ---
  10. Commit the Resolved Merge

  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "Merge GitHub .gitignore with project-specific ignores"
  Why: After resolving the conflict, we need to stage and commit the resolved file to complete the
   merge.

  ---
  11. Push to GitHub

  git push -u origin main
  Why: Uploads your local commits to GitHub.
  - -u (or --set-upstream) sets up tracking between your local 'main' and remote 'origin/main'
  - This means future git push commands will know where to push without specifying the remote and
  branch

  Key Concepts Explained

  Staging vs Committing:
  - git add = Stage files (prepare them)
  - git commit = Save the staged files as a snapshot

  Local vs Remote:
  - Local = Your computer
  - Remote = GitHub server
  - git pull = Download changes from remote
  - git push = Upload changes to remote

  Conflict Resolution:
  - --ours = Keep local version
  - --theirs = Keep remote version
  - Manual edit = Combine both versions

  Branch Tracking:
  - -u flag creates a link between local and remote branches
  - After this, you can just use git push instead of git push origin main

  This workflow is the standard process when connecting an existing local project to a new GitHub
  repository that already has some files (like .gitignore or LICENSE).

  Why Step 9 Was Needed

  When I did git checkout --theirs .gitignore, I accepted GitHub's complete .gitignore file, which
   is a comprehensive Python .gitignore with 200+ lines covering all sorts of Python tools and
  frameworks.

  However, GitHub's .gitignore was generic - it didn't include our project-specific ignores like:
  - logs/ - our application's log directory
  - output/ - our generated reports directory
  - *.xlsx and *.xls - Excel files we don't want in version control

  The Problem

  If I had just used GitHub's .gitignore without modification:
  1. ✅ Standard Python files would be ignored (__pycache__/, .venv/, etc.)
  2. ❌ But our logs/ and output/ folders would be tracked by Git
  3. ❌ Any .xlsx test files would be committed to the repository

  The Solution

  Step 9 added our project-specific patterns to the end of GitHub's comprehensive .gitignore:

  # ... (GitHub's 200+ lines of Python ignores)

  # Project specific  ← Added this section
  logs/
  output/
  *.xlsx
  *.xls
  ~$*.xlsx
  ~$*.xls

  This way we got the best of both worlds:
  - GitHub's comprehensive Python .gitignore (covers 99% of cases)
  - Plus our custom project needs (covers our specific requirements)

  Alternative Approach

  I could have instead:
  1. Used --ours to keep our simpler .gitignore
  2. But then we'd miss all the useful ignores from GitHub's template (like .pytest_cache/,
  .ruff_cache/, .pixi/, etc.)
